[JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) is a big leap forward in how we can write web applications that are easy to write, deploy, scale, and also maintain. Using this approach means that newly created content is rendered from a content API, while a static render of it is being built into the site for future.

## Get Started
To build and play with this app, follow the build instructions that are located here: [https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/battlestax](https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/battlestax#prerequisites)

# Running BattleStax
Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites
Let's do some initial setup.

### DataStax Astra
1. Create a [DataStax Astra account](https://astra.datastax.com/register?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=battlestax) if you don't 
already have one:

2. On the home page. Locate the button **`Add Database`**

## Running the full game
*Make sure you've completed the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) before starting this step*
  - [Running on your local machine](#running-on-your-local-machine)

### Running on your local machine

1. Check out the `full-game` branch
```sh
git fetch
git checkout full-game
```

2. Create a `.env` file and fill it with values from the `.env.example` file.

3. Make sure the package dependencies are installed
```sh
# install dependencies
npm install
```

3. Then, start the app in dev mode. Changes in the `src` or `functions` directories will trigger reloads.
```sh
# start battlestax in dev mode
npm run dev
```
